The following are three programs written as Research at the Georgia Institute of Technology's Space Systems Design Lab with Professor Hirabayashi by Anay Naik in April 2024. 


Each program has its own README.md File going into detail on the description, how to use the program, and important information and formulas used. Each of these files build on each other, becoming more complex and robust, but still being able to function individually to accomplish their unique goals. They are listed below with a short summary of the function of each program.


Vector Output Research Summary:
This program script loads a .tab file using an inputted file, extracts specific columns and rows, and then generates a 3D vector output figure. This is based on data from vertex and tile vectors that are both in the file.


Single Aperture Refractive Telescope Research Summary:
This program script asks the user in a pop-up window for the following parameters: focal length in centimeters, height in centimeters, boresight or surface angle in degrees, and the input pixel count. The output is an X array and a Y array that correspond to the input values.


Three Dimensional Refractive Telescope Research Summary:
This program script asks the user for the following parameters: The aperture location x,y, and z coordinates, the aperture length and width, and the three triangular facet node vertex coordinates for the x, y and z axis. The output is an X matrix, Y matrix, and Z matrix for the corresponding coordinates based off of the inputted values.
